# node-slcan

## Introduction

*** This has not been tested in the real world yet ***

Tools for a serial line can connection, using the protocol found here:  
http://www.can232.com/docs/can232_v3.pdf

This is not an unabridged rendition of the protocol.  This is missing bits that I don't currently
need.  If you need them added, please put in a issue (no promises when I might get to it) or a pull
request.

## Serial Port

This uses node-serialport to actually connect to the port.  Documentation for that project can be
found here:

https://serialport.io/docs/

## Usage

~~~~~ts
import Slcan from "slcan";
import { SerialPort } from "serialport";

const can = new Slcan(new SerialPort({path: "/dev/ttyUSB0", baudRate: 115200}));

can.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(data);
    /* Returns data as:
     *  {
     *      id:  number,         // CAN id
     *      data: Buffer,        // CAN data,
     *      length: number,      // CAN length (different from data.length),
     *      ext: boolean,        // True if extended CAN frame
     *      rtr: boolean,        // True if a CAN retry frame
     *      error: boolean,      // True if this packet has errors
     *      timestamp?: number,  // The timestamp in ms for this packet.  
     *                           // Maxes out at 60,000 and rolls over.
     *  }
     */
});

can.on('open', () => {
    /* Send a standard packet */
    can.send({id: 123, data: Buffer.from("01020304", "hex")});

    /* Send a extended packet */
    can.send({id: 123, ext: true, data: Buffer.from("01020304", "hex")});

    /* Close the CAN connection */
    can.close();
});

can.open();
